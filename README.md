# Intrument-Classification-with-KNN
To work, this requires this dataset to be in the same directory as the program: https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/irmas 

This was my contribution to my group project in the Fall 2017 Machine Learning class. This program performs feature extraction on the soundbites, then loops through a list of K's to determine which one gives the best accuracy, which should be around 50%. (The phd thesis this was based on, which tried many more models, had an accuracy of around 58%. https://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ffuhrmann/PhD/ffuhrmann_PhDthesis.pdf)
